# Privacy policy

Notiondipity collects the contents of you Notion pages either through the Notion API or
by directly accessing the contents of a Notion page in your browser.

The page title is kept unencrypted, but the actual contents of all your pages is encrypted
with your unique Notion user ID. This ID is stored only locally on your computer. In our database 
we store only its hash. Hash is a piece of text generated by applying a mathematical function
to your Notion ID. It is easy to create a hash from an ID, but it is extremely difficult to find the
original ID from its hash. As a consequence, we can't see the contents of your notion pages.

## Third parties

Functions such as finding similar pages, listing similarities, differences, and combinations of ideas
in pages, or generating new ideas rely on Open AI APIs. This means that when you are using these 
features, we have to decrypt the contents of your pages and send it to Open AI.
